Test #1: K-Means & Fuzzy C Means
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that K-Means is better than Fuzzy C Means

Test #2: K-Means & Gaussian Mixture Model
	P-value: 2.304640495293415e-24
	From the P-value above we can infer that Gaussian Mixture Model is better than K-Means

Test #3: Gaussian Mixture Model & Agglomerative Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that Gaussian Mixture Model is better than Agglomerative Clustering

Test #4: Gaussian Mixture Model & Spectral Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that Gaussian Mixture Model is better than Spectral Clustering

For conclusion, the best algorithm for the current data (according to the T-test) is Gaussian Mixture Model
