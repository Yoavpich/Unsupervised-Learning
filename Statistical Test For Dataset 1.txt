Test #1: K-Means & Fuzzy C Means
	P-value: 2.5807971603063308e-26
	From the P-value above we can infer that Fuzzy C Means is better than K-Means

Test #2: Fuzzy C Means & Gaussian Mixture Model
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that Fuzzy C Means is better than Gaussian Mixture Model

Test #3: Fuzzy C Means & Agglomerative Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that Fuzzy C Means is better than Agglomerative Clustering

Test #4: Fuzzy C Means & Spectral Clustering
	P-value: 1.0
	From the P-value above we can infer that Fuzzy C Means is better than Spectral Clustering

For conclusion, the best algorithm for the current data (according to the T-test) is Fuzzy C Means
